# How Renewables Shift Sector Energy Composition

Some takeaways from this research project:
* Increased renewable energy consumption is correlated with a higher portion of total energy consumption in the industrial sector.
* States with lower energy intensity (energy per dollar) use less energy for industry, meaning states that consume energy for manufacturing spend more per unit of energy. Energy for industry is less efficient, even though it may cost less than residential or commercial consumption per unit.
* Integration of renewable energy changes how a state's total energy is divided between economic sectors.
